# rest_api-mongo-p9
The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database. In addition, the project will require users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database. 

To run this app, open three terminal windows:

-in the first window run "mongod", 
-in the second window run "mongo", 
-then on the third window type "npm install", after the dependencies are added type "node app.js" and the website should be running on localhost:5000
